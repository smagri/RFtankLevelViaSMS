Needed to run udevPermission script for being able to program arduino uno wifi rev2.

I get a warning though when you program it saying this will result in
an error in future versions so may not work long term.  You can avoid
worrying about the warning for now though.

It just adds a udev rule for arduino uno wifi rev2 in
/etc/udev/rules./99-arduino-uno-wifi-rev2.rules
