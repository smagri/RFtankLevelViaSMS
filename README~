The aim of  this project is to  mount the TX nRF2401  interfaced to an
arduino module  under the  lid of  the water tank  and the  water tank
level, via the distance sensor, is sent to me once a day via sms.

See  nRF24L01/ for  details of  arduino  code for  RF transmission  of
distance sensor values, combined with sending  an sms to me once a day
via  the ifttt  cloud service  of the  distance.  This  TX code  on an
arduino  uno,  rf.smagri.tx,  reads  the  distance  sensor  value  and
transmits the  value using  an RF  chip called  nRF2401 and  sends the
value to the RX code on  another nRF2401, rf.smagri.rx, on the arduino
of  the Jaycar  wifi  board.  The  Jaycar wifi  board  has a  combined
arduino and esp8266 wifi  chip on it. So the esp8266  is used with the
esp8266iftttJson.smagri  code to  send  an  sms to  me  via the  ifttt
service  once a  day.  The  aim of  this project  is to  mount the  TX
nRF2401 and  arduino module under  the lid of  the water tank  and the
water tank level,  via the distance sensor,  is sent to me  once a day
via sms.



esp8266iftttJson.smagri/ Standalone code contains the code that sends
an sms on the jaycar esp8266 wifi board.  This was derived from
looking at internet examples and Dre's code.  It now reads a serial
string input on the serial port as is required when
GettingStarted.smagri.ino sends the rf data to it.  It uses ifttt
service with Json strings to achieve this.


esp8266ifttt/
Contains the code that sends an sms on the esp8266 01 wifi board.

All other esp8266 directories are experiments or stepping stone test code.

arduinoUnoWiFi.rev2/ is testing the wifi code on the arduino wifi
where the nRF24 rf code did not work.
