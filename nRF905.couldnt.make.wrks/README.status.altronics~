* installed altronics library into arduino ide and copied original examples to
  dataTX.altronics.sjm.ino and dataRX.altronics.sjm.ino.

* I could not even get these scripts to compile properly.

* Also,  the wiring  diagram is  not  given, I  was going  to use  zak
  kembles wiring diagram  and change the pin numbers  in the altronics
  example .h  file but this is  all looking like too  much work again.
  Going  back to  zak kemble's  code as  this looks  like the  arduino
  officially supported code.
