//  Working Version V2

/* Written by Michael Welsh September 7, 2017 for implementation using the Arduino UNO
 * To be used with complementary program receiver_sample_JMW_V1
 *  
 * This program is designed to integrate the UNO and nRF905.  It operates in a
 * TRANSMIT mode to send data to the receiver.  The receiver is also integrated to 
 * a UNO and NRF905.  This program sends up to 16 integer data types (2 bytes each) for a 
 * maximum 32 byte packet.  Range for integer is -32768 through 32767.
 * 
 * 
 * It is the goal to develop a program which integrates a UNO with a 
 * MPU6050, and NRF905 transmitter in order to send acceleration data to the receiver 
 * and then to a Processing program which will graphically present the data
 * as a vehicle in a 3 dimensional space.
 * 
 * Program and Library adopted from the Rethink Tech Inc. - Tinkbox (nRF905) and the
 * Jeff Rowberg I2C device class using the Digital Motion Processing (DMP), MotionApps 2.0, 
 * (MPU6050_DMP6).
 * 
 * This program uses 3,908 Bytes (12%) on the UNO.
 * 
 * UNO to nRF905 BOARD PIN and Control Feature
 *
 * 7 -> CE     Standby - High = TX/RX mode, Low = Standby
 * 8 -> PWR    Power Up - High = On, Low = Off
 * 9 -> TXE    TX or RX mode - High = TX, Low = RX
 * 2 -> CD     Carrier Detect - High when RF signal detected, for collision avoidance 
 * 3 -> DR     Data Ready - High when finished transmitting/data received
 * 10 -> CSN   SPI SS
 * 12 -> SO    SPI MISO
 * 11 -> SI    SPI MOSI
 * 13 -> SCK   SPI SCK
 * GND -> GND  Ground
 
   Note on use of the CD Pin.  I have completed a test in which the trasnmitter
   was able to send data to the Receiver with this pin disconnected.  This may be usefull
   because this pin may be required when using the MPU6050 which uses Pin 2 of the UNO
   for interrupt processing.  Both the transmitter and receiver CD connection is 
   optional for this program.
