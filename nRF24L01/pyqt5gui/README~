Could not easily  work out howto get  the input from the  Text box for
the name  of the serial  port, so I implemented  it as a  command line
argument for now.

Perhaps need to experiment with combo box, see inline code for a start.

Web  pages used/read  to create  code should  be saved  in Evernote  I
think, otherwise google  again as I didn't save them  here.  Have been
trying to use Evernote  more but maybe this was a  wrong choise in the
end as it locks me in to them.  I could export the clipped addless web
pages, the strength  and why I use evernote, but  I think sometimes it
doesn't export them properly and saving the web pages with adds on the
hard drive results in unreadable pdf's anyhow.
