This is the working code directory GettingStarted.smagri/ for TX which
includes  reading distance  sensor.  GettingStarted.smagri.rx/ for  RX
which just recives distance sensor value.

Both these  are now rf.smagri.tx and  rf.smagri.rx respectively, ready
for major  changes to get  to the final  solution of sending  just the
distance value and then reciving an sms, with no debug messages in the
code  or the  rx code  will get  confused.  This  works but  make sure
arduino wifi uno has  dip switch with 1 and 2 bits on.   It may take a
little while for the sms to get through.
